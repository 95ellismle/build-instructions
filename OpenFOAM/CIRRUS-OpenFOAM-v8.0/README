# This is OpenFOAM v8 (Released 22nd July 2020)
# See https://openfoam.org/version/8/
#
# Here using gcc (default gcc/6.3.0) and mpt (default mpt/2.22)
# (an historical choice, rather than anything else).
#
# Create a directory FOAM_INST_DIR with an apprropriate location.
# Copy the site directory (herewith) to FOAM_INST_DIR.
#
# This README is assumed to be in FOAM_INST_DIR (this directory)
# which contains
# ./site/install.sh
# ./site/modules.sh
# ./site/compile.sh
# ./site/prefs.sh
# ./site/q-compile.sh
# ./site/q-test.sh
#
# Downloads
#
# From this directory
#  $ bash ./site/install.sh
# to download and unpack the source and third party packages.
#
# You should see, e.g.,
#  $ ls
#  OpenFOAM-8
#  OpenFOAM-8-20200722.tar.gz
#  site
#  ThirdParty-8
#  ThirdParty-8-version-8.tar.gz
#
# Compilation
#
# ./site/prefs.sh sets WM_MPILIB=SGIMPI to pick up mpt, and everything
# else is unchanged.
#
# Submit a batch job for compilation
#  $ sbatch ./site/q-compile.sh
# to compile (takes 40 minutes or so).
#
# Test
#
# The file q-test.sh contains a smoke test, which may wish to include
# any local module details.
#
#  $ sbatch ./site/q-test.sh
